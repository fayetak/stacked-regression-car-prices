I recently uploaded my work on the "Stacked Regression Car Prices" competition from Kaggle, 
where I'm predicting second-hand car prices. 
Currently, I'm ranked in the top 20%. This is not only my first time sharing a project on GitHub but also my first competition. 
For the model, I used a stacking regressor with three base models:

A linear regression model with standard preprocessing,
A LightGBM model with finely-tuned hyperparameters,
And a CatBoost model with its best-tuned hyperparameters.

This approach significantly improved the model's performance and provided me with valuable experience in stacking regression models.
